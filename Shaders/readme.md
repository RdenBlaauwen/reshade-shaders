PLEASE NOTE:

HQAA.fx, XHQAA.fx, HQLAA.fx, ASSMAA.fx, FSMAA.fx ALL require you to install the SweetFX effects package when you install ReShade to your game. They WILL NOT COMPILE if you skip this step.

If you have previously used SMAA or FXAA with your game and you run into errors compiling HQAA, try uninstalling ReShade from the game and then re-installing it (or, you can just delete the profile.ini file being used with the game).
